# Image-Processing-CIFAR-100


The Goal - Image Classification using CIFAR100 dataset using Deep Learning Algorithms

The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 100 classes. It has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.

After preprocessing we applied data augmentation, which is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data.

In addition we applied transfer learning, which is the improvement of learning in a new task through the transfer of knowledge from a related task that has already been learned, for that we chose RESNET50 model which that has already optimal wheights (learned on imagenet dataset).
